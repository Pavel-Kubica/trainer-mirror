### Guarantor interface

As an guarantor most of your added functionality is available through the guarantor button.
Using this button you can either work with the subject you are assigned to or edit the topics.

### Course creation

You will have the option to create the course - add the name, access code, short name and assign teachers
to the lesson. You can also choose if you want to make the course public.
You can also choose already existing course to edit from the right drawer.

### Topic creation

The last feature that is now available in the guarantor interface is the creation of topics. You can create a topic that can be later on used to characterize a certain group of modules.
To create a topic go to the topics tab and press the CREATE A TOPIC button.
