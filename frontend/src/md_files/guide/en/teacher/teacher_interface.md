### Courses
On the homepage, you will see an overview of the courses you are teaching (or of which you were a member as a student).
A course usually represents a single parallel.

### Weeks and Lessons

The course consists of individual weeks (they can, but don't have to correspond to the teaching weeks) that contain lessons (1 lesson ~ 1 topic).
You can create new weeks, or copy existing ones. The same applies to the lessons that will populate your weeks.
The copy feature allows you to take a week or lesson from any other course which you teach or have taught, and import it to the one you are currently editing.

### Modules

A lesson consists of individual modules. Think of a module as a single task for students to do, or in some cases to view.
Currently, the system supports 4 main types of modules: Text module, Assignment module, Quiz module and Code module.

The text module is used to statically display a block of text.
You can use Markdown formatting and upload images (image icon on the top left).
You can use the *Assignment* tab of other module types in the same ways.
Assignment modules give a task that students solve by submitting an image. Quiz modules are designed for interactive in-class use, where students
have a short amount of time to answer True/False or ABCD type questions, similar to a service such as Kahoot. Code modules allow for the compilation,
linking, execution and testing of C and C++ code.

To add a module to your lesson, unfold its row when viewing it, and you either create a new module, or add an existing one.
Using the "plus" button will simply add the module - editing it afterwards will edit it in all lessons. 
Even so, student solutions are still always specific to a lesson-module pair. Use the copy button to
make a deep copy, of which you will then also be the author. The copy week/lesson feature uses the "Add" mechanism (shallow copy).
