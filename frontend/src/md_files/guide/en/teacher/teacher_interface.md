### Teacher interface
After logging in, you will see an overview of the courses you are teaching (or of which you were a member as a student).

Use the blue arrow on the right to get to the course details. Your course will initially be empty, so it won't contain any weeks, lessons, or users (other than you).

### Creation of the first week

The course consists of individual weeks (they should correspond to the teaching weeks) that contain lessons (1 lesson ~ 1 topic).

To create a week, press the plus button at the bottom right. Enter a week name and select a start and end date. If you add more weeks, the dates shifted by 1 week will automatically be prefilled.

To create a lesson, press the + button in the week row.

Once created, you will be redirected to edit the newly created lesson. A new item Modules will appear in the menu on the left.

### Adding the first module to a new lesson

The lesson consists of individual modules. Think of the module as a task, a piece of work that the student has to do during the exercise. Currently, the system supports 4 types of modules: Code module, Text module, Quiz module and Assignment module.

To add/modify modules in the lesson, select the Modules tab in the left menu. Here you will see a list of modules (so far empty) with the option to add an existing module or create a new module.

Press Create new module. You will be taken to the module creation interface. You can fill in the module name and module type in the interface. You can leave other settings and options blank for now. Depending on the selected type of module, additional items for editing and setting a specific type of module will appear in the menu on the left.

For simplicity, choose the Text module. The text module is used to statically display a block of text. In the menu on the left, select the Entry item, in which you can write in Markdown format, for example, some additional information or instructions on how to operate the IDE.

In addition to Markdown, the editor also supports KaTEX for writing mathematical expressions, Mermaid for graphs, uploading images (image icon on the top left) and also HTML.

Once you have finished editing, press the Create button to create the module. The module will be automatically added to the lesson and you will be redirected to edit it.

When editing a module, be careful that modules are shared between lessons and courses, so don't break a module in another lesson by editing a module in one lesson. The option to copy the module is used for this purpose.

### View of the first lecture

Now look at the student view from the module edit using the eye.
