### Overview of students

Users in the course have two roles: Teacher and Student. Based on a previous request, only wrzecond and matuj10 are currently assigned the role Teacher to the course. (You can find us on Discord: @kvetinac97 and @honzamatousek or write to e-mail). The Student role is the default for anyone who joins the course using a join code.

In the current concept, the course corresponds to any group of students that you plan to teach together. So if a teacher has a group on Monday 9:15 and 11:00 and Wednesday 12:45 and 14:15, one course will be Monday and the other Wednesday. If a teacher teaches repeaters on Mondays at 12:45pm and freshmen at 2:30pm, it may be better to have two separate courses (with repeaters you will go at a different pace).

### Connection code

In the student overview, each teacher has the option to set a connection code (CHANGE CODE button). If the code is set, each student has the option to join the course with the given code on the start page (JOIN THE COURSE). This is useful, for example, in a situation where a student from another parallel comes to the exercise.

### Overview of students in the course
