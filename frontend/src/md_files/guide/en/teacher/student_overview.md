### Course users

Users in a course can have one of two roles: Teacher or Student.
The Student role is the default for anyone who joins the course using a join code. Teachers must be assigned by either an admin
or guarantor for every course (currently the job of @matouj10). The administrator will also usually import the corresponding students from KOS,
you do not have to do this manually.

### Join code

In the course's detail, you have the option to set a join code by clicking on the button of the same name.
If the code is set, students may join the course with the given code on the homepage using the "Join a course" button.
This is useful for example in situations where a student from another parallel comes to yours.

### Solution view

In the solution view, you may use the left sidebar's top toggle to switch between solutions for the same module by different users,
or solutions by the same user for different modules in that week. You may also use the right sidebar to switch between
the module's tests and the requests and answers for that student.

In the case of a code module, you may also comment lines of code directly.
Previous code comments will be shown for the last answered request, both to you and the student.
