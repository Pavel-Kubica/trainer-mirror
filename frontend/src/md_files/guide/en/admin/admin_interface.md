### Admin interface

As an administrator most of your added functionality is available through the admin button in the top right corner of the page, next to your username.

### Courses

A single course corresponds to a single parallel.
To create a course, you must first create a subject and a semester in their respective tabs. A subject is created with the
blue button at the bottom right, while a course is created with the "plus" button on the subject's row.

It is recommended to set the name and short name to both be descriptive of that parallel, for example
`Lab no. 103, Monday 12:30` and `L103` respectively.

The access code is a code that students can enter to join this course. Teachers can later change this code.

You can also choose if you want to make the course public. Usually a user needs to be added to a course in order
to view it, but a public course is visible to anyone.

### Topic creation

The last feature available in the admin interface is the creation of topics.
Topics can later be used to characterize a certain group of modules.
