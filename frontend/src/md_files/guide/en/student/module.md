# How to work with different modules

## Code module

In the code module you can see the tabbed panel at the top - ASSIGNMENT, student.cpp. When you switch to the student.cpp
tab, the code editor is shown instead of the assignment.

You can type the code directly into the editor and then execute it using a keyboard shortcut (Mac: Ctrl + R, Windows:
Win + R) or the RUN TESTS button.

If you prefer to use the IDE, download the source code using the download button, edit the code locally, and then upload
it using the box labeled Code (.c, .cpp, ...). Once the file is uploaded, testing will automatically start.



!!! danger Alert
Multi-file modules are used in some courses. In this case you will see MULTIPLE code files behind the assignment tab.
With multi-file modules, you can still click through the tabs and use the editor for individual files / download or
upload the file whose tab is currently open.
But with multi-file modules, there is also the option of smart download and upload. On the ASSIGNMENT tab you can
download an archive with all files, and then upload these files back. The only condition for a successful upload is
that the file must have the same name as in the bookmark (e.g. bookmark CRegex.cpp = file must be named CRegex.cpp).

Po spuštění testů se v pravém panelu objeví výsledky jednotlivých testů. Ty buď projdou úspěšně (zelený proužek, ikona ✅), nebo selžou (červený proužek, ikona ❌). V případě selhání se otevře panel s výsledky testu, které si můžete zobrazit v podobě přehledného diffu.![Test output](/images_for_md_files/guides/en/student/code/difference.png)

## Self test module

Self tests are a great way to check your knowledge. On the main page you will see number of questions and time limit, so
you can choose which parameters you want to set. After clicking on the "LAUNCH" button, the test will start. 
![Self test question](/images_for_md_files/guides/en/student/selftest/selftest_question.png)
You can see the remaining time on the right. After the time runs out, the test will end automatically. You can also end
the test manually by clicking on the "TO REVIEW" button and then clicking "SUBMIT". After the test is finished, you will see the results. You can
see the correct answers and your answers.
