## Course Details

Each course is divided into weeks, and each week contains lessons.

- Weeks are highlighted in **bold** and include the date of the course.
- Lessons show a **progress bar** that indicates your progress, and the arrow button lets you access the lesson.

Two symbols may appear next to the lesson name. The stopwatch icon (‚è±Ô∏è) means that the lesson contains problems where
you get a special "badge" ‚ö°Ô∏è for solving them on time (by the end of the lesson). The key icon (üîë) means that the lesson
contains problems that are locked with a code that the teacher tells you.
