# How to work with lessons

## Lesson details
![](/images_for_md_files/guides/en/student/lesson/lesson_detail.png)
In the lesson details you can see the menu with the individual tasks on the left. Each task has a colored bar on the
left that indicates the status of the task.

Red means that the task is not completed.
Yellow means that the task is not completed and the student has asked the teacher for help.
Blue means that the task has passed the automated tests and is awaiting manual grading by the teacher.
Green means that the task has passed the automatic tests.

You can then find different emoticons next to the task name:

🔑 means that the task is locked and you need to know the code from the trainer to unlock it.  
⏱️ means that you will get a special badge  
⚡️ for solving the task on time by the end of the lesson.  
🏆 means that you have successfully solved the task  
⚡️ means that you have solved the problem by the end of the lesson  
😿 means you have asked for help  
⬆️ means you have asked for a manual assessment by the teacher

There are two types of assignments: those that only have automatic tests and those that require manual grading in
addition. To complete the first type, just pass all the tests, and the cup icon (🏆) will appear automatically. To
complete the second type, you need to request an evaluation (the SUBMIT button) after completing all the tests.
